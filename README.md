# Photo editor app
## Description
In this app, there is a canvas with editing tools on the left and right sides. Users can import
and resize images from their computer, modify them, or draw their own by utilizing shapes, text,
the paint bucket, and drawing lines. 

## Development
Prior to starting this project, I had viewed some impressive HTML5 Canvas projects and had also 
created another project with animations. However, for this project, my goal was to create a highly
interactive HTML5 Canvas. To achieve this, I used only HTML5, CSS, and Javascript for manipulating
the native CanvasContext. I referred to the Mozilla Documentation to learn more about the CanvasContext properties, 
which helped me a lot. However, the most challenging aspects of this project were developing the logic, saving the 
context in a different variable, creating an algorithm to draw circles/arcs, and implementing the paint bucket feature.

## Features
- Opening files of different sizes on PCs.
- Downloading canvas images.
- Changing image resolution.
- Changing or disabling aspect ratio.
- Writing text with various options. 
- Drawing lines with different colors and widths. 
- Creating shapes such as rectangles, circles, triangles, arcs, and straight lines.
